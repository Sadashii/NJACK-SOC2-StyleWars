    <h2>About the Light Side</h2>
    <div class="view-content">
        <p>
            The Light Side is dedicated to crafting digital experiences that are clear, inviting, and energizing. Our
            members value transparency, readability, and a sense of space in every design.
        </p>
        <p>
            We encourage thoughtful layouts, accessible color palettes, and designs that make every visitor feel
            welcome. From the earliest days of the web, advocates of the Light Side have championed simplicity and
            openness, believing that information should be easy to find and understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our philosophy is rooted in the idea that less is more. By minimizing distractions and focusing on what
            truly matters, we create digital spaces that foster learning, connection, and creativity.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            We strive to set new standards for web accessibility and user experience. Through workshops, collaborative
            projects, and open discussions, we empower designers and developers to build sites that shine‚Äîregardless of
            device or ability.

    <h2>Our Virtues</h2>
    <div class="view-content">
        <div class="virtue virtue1">
            <h3>Clarity</h3>
            <h4>Simple and Intuitive</h4>
            <p>
                Every element is placed with purpose. We minimize clutter and use whitespace to guide the eye, ensuring
                users can focus on what matters most. Navigation menus are straightforward, and content is structured
                logically to reduce cognitive load.
            </p>
            <h4>Readable Typography</h4>
            <p>
                Fonts are chosen for legibility and comfort. Headings stand out, and body text is easy to scan and
                understand. We pay close attention to line height, font size, and contrast, making sure that every word
                is a pleasure to read.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clarity also means clear calls to action. Buttons are distinct, and links are descriptive, guiding users
                effortlessly through the site.
            </p>
            <button class="button1">Explore Clarity</button>
        </div>
        <div class="virtue virtue2">
            <h3>Openness</h3>
            <h4>Welcoming Layouts</h4>
            <p>
                Our pages invite exploration, with open navigation and clear calls to action. We avoid barriers, making
                information accessible to all. Whether you‚Äôre browsing on a phone, tablet, or desktop, our layouts adapt
                to your needs.
            </p>
            <h4>Inclusive Design</h4>
            <p>
                Accessibility is a priority. We use high-contrast colors, descriptive links, and ensure our sites work
                for everyone. Our designs are tested with screen readers and keyboard navigation to guarantee universal
                usability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Openness also means sharing knowledge. We publish guides, host Q&A sessions, and encourage members to
                contribute resources for the benefit of the whole community.
            </p>

            <h3>Energy</h3>
            <h4>Vibrant Visuals</h4>
            <p>
                Bright accents and uplifting imagery keep users engaged and motivated. We use color to create a
                positive, energetic atmosphere. Visual cues such as icons, highlights, and banners help direct attention
                and add personality to our designs.
            </p>
            <h4>Interactive Experiences</h4>
            <p>
                Subtle animations and responsive feedback make every interaction enjoyable and intuitive. Hover effects,
                transitions, and micro-interactions bring the interface to life without overwhelming the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                Energy is about momentum. We encourage users to participate, share feedback, and become a part of the
                Light Side‚Äôs ongoing story.
